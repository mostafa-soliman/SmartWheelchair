# SmartWheelchair
The primary idea of the Smart Wheelchair is that users can direct it to their desired destination within the house
through voice commands. The voice command will be processed and generate a navigation goal for the navigation
algorithm, which determines the chair's current location relative to the house and generates a path plan from the
chair's position to the desired location. The project uses motors and sensors based on Atmega32.
